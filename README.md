# ICSSR-CIFAR10-Image-Classification
Train an image classifier for the 10 CIFAR-10 classes
Problem Statement
Classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories using deep learning.

Train/Test Split
Used official CIFAR-10 split:
50,000 training images
10,000 test images

Models
Baseline CNN (2 Conv layers)
Improved CNN (4 Conv layers + Dropout + Augmentation)

Metrics
Test Accuracy
Training Loss

Best Result
An improved CNN achieved 78% test accuracy.

Conclusion
Adding data augmentation and deeper convolution layers significantly improved performance.
